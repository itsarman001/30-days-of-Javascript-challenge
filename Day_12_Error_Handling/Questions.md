## Day 12: Error Handling in Markdown

**Tasks/Activities:**

* **Activity 1: Basic Error Handling with Try-Catch**
    * **Task 1:** Write a function that throws an error and use a try-catch block to handle it.
    * **Task 2:** Create a function that divides numbers and handles division by zero using try-catch.
* **Activity 2: Finally Block**
    * **Task 3:** Write a script with a try-catch-finally block to observe execution flow.
* **Activity 3: Custom Error Objects**
    * **Task 4:** Create a custom error class and throw it in a function, handling it with try-catch.
    * **Task 5:** Write a function that validates user input and throws a custom error if validation fails, using try-catch to handle it.
* **Activity 4: Error Handling in Promises**
    * **Task 6:** Create a promise that resolves or rejects, using `.catch()` to handle rejection.
    * **Task 7:** Use try-catch within an async function to handle errors from a promise.
* **Activity 5: Graceful Error Handling in Fetch**
    * **Task 8:** Use `fetch` to request data from an invalid URL, handling the error with `.catch()`.
    * **Task 9:** Use `fetch` with an invalid URL within an async function and handle the error using try-catch.

**Feature Request:**

* **Basic Error Handling Script:** Write a script demonstrating try-catch and finally blocks.
* **Custom Error Script:** Create a script with custom errors and try-catch handling.
* **Promise Error Handling Script:** Write a script that handles errors in promises.
* **Fetch Error Handling Script:** Create a script that handles errors when fetching data with `fetch`.

**Achievement:**

By the end of these activities, students will:

* Understand and implement basic error handling with try-catch.
* Use finally blocks for code execution regardless of try-catch outcome.
* Create and utilize custom error classes.
* Handle errors in promises using `.catch()` and try-catch within async functions.
* Implement graceful error handling when making network requests with `fetch`.
